Create a simple project where:
The state manages a user’s profile (name, email).
The props pass this data from the parent component to a child component.
There is an event handler to change the profile data on form submission.
Use conditional rendering to show a message when the user is logged in or out.
Simple Project Structure:
src/
│
├── components/
│   ├── ProfileForm.js  # Form for updating user profile
│   └── UserProfile.js  # Component to display the user's profile
│
├── App.js              # Parent component managing state and props
└── index.js            # Main entry point
